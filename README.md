# Hi, I'm Pedro ðŸ‘‹

### I'm a ðŸ“Š **Data Analyst** at [**Farfetch**](https://www.farfetch.com/).
My daily time is spent in ***SQL***, ***BigQuery***, a little bit of ***Python***, and some ***dbt***. I love to learn, and I discover this new love for data, 4 years ago. I'm now trying to get more knowledge about ***Data Engineering*** and ***Cloud Services*** to prepare for the futur... sorry, the present. 


Recently I was a pisciner in [42 School](https://www.42porto.com/), learning C language.
Right now I'm trying to share my knowledge and some things that I do and at the same time, trying to specialize in SQL and learn more about **Data Engineering** and **ML**.
